My Interaction Design (IxD) Clan worked together to produce a list of principles of how we 'do' interaction design, along with recommended good practice. 
These are to be extended to the wider DfE IxD community so we follow the same standards for more consistent and predictable designs which make our services more familiar and therefore easier to use for our users.
