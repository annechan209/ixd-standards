My Interaction Design (IxD) Clan worked together to produce interaction design standards (e.g. principles and good practice for how we 'do' interaction design, ways of working etc). 
These are to be extended to the wider DfE IxD community so we follow the same standards for more consistent and predictable designs which make our services more familiar and therefore easier to use for our users.
